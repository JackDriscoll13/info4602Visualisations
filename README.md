# Modern Mozart
Information Visualization Project

We created a visualization corresponding to a piece of music made with a dj board. 
The final deliverable is in the mp4 file in this repo. Please see the writeup for a 
deatailed description of our research and creation process. 

UPDATE: We weren't able to upload mp4 file to github nor add all source code required.
